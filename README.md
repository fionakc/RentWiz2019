# RentWiz2019

## This is the code produced by the 2018/2019 MSWDev class for RentWiz.

### There are 3 main parts to this project, divided into A,B,and C. 
Each part has multiple branches.
### There is also a single all_combined branch where the three projects were combined into one,
but due to time constraints there will be conflicts that need to be resolved before this combined project
will run.

### As far as I can determine, the most recent branches for each part are:
### A: GroupA_html
### B: GroupB_Final2.Final
### C: 2_newDev (I think??)
